## Purpose
**VOC2CORE** is a server written in python which listens at port `9999` for incoming TCP connections to provide a command line interface to manipulate a [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) pipeline it runs.
The gstreamer pipeline is meant to mix several incoming video and audio sources to different output sources.

Particularly it can be used to send mixtures of the incoming video and audio sources to a live audience and/or to a recording server.

**VOC2CORE** can be easily adapted to different scenarios by changing it's configuration.

One can use a simple terminal connection to control the mixing process or **VOC2GUI** which provides a visual interface that shows previews of all sources and the mixed output as well as a toolbar for all mixing commands.

## Features

**VOC2CORE** currently provides the following features:

* [Matroska](http://www.matroska.org/) enveloped A/V source input via TCP
* Image sources via URI
* [Decklink](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink) grabbed A/V sources
* GStreamer generated test sources
* [Matroska](http://www.matroska.org/) enveloped A/V output via TCP
* Scaling of input sources to the desired output format
* Conversion of input formats to the desired output format
* Composition of video sources to a mixed video output (e.g. Picture in Picture)
* Blinding of mixed video and audio output (formerly known as "stream blanking", e.g. to interrupt live streaming between talks)
* Low resolution preview outputs of sources and mix for lower bandwidth monitoring
* High resolution outputs of sources and mix for high quality recording
* Remote controlling via command line interface
* Video transitions for fading any cuts
* Image overlays (e.g. for lower thirds)
* Reading a so-called [`schedule.xml`](https://github.com/voc/voctosched) which can provide meta data about the talks and that is used to address images individually for each talk that can be selected as overlay (e.g. speaker descriptions in lower thirds)
* Customization of video composites and transitions

## Mixing Pipeline

The following graph shows a simplified mixing pipeline.
The real GStreamer pipeline is much more complicated.
A so-called [DOT graph](https://www.graphviz.org/) of it can be generated by starting **VOC2CORE** with option `-d`. Those DOT graph files can be viewed with [xdot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py) for example.

### Input Elements

#### Sources

Live audio/video input can be delivered in different *kinds* via **TCP** in **Matroska format** or from a **Decklink A/V grabber** source. It is also possible to use **image** and **test** sources, but this mostly make sense for testing purposes.

All input sources must be named uniquely and listed in `mix/sources` within the configuration file:

```
[mix]
sources = cam1,cam2
```

Without any further configuration this will produce two test sources named `cam1` and `cam2`.

##### Test Sources

Without any further configuration a source becomes a **test source** by default.
Every test source will add a [videotestsrc](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/videotestsrc/index.html?gi-language=python) and an [audiotestsrc](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/audiotestsrc/index.html?gi-language=python) element to the internal GStreamer pipeline and so it produces a test video and sound.
As in the order they appear in `mix/sources` the test patterns of all test sources will iterate through the [GStreamer test pattern values](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/videotestsrc/index.html?gi-language=python#members-2) beginning with the value `snow` (followed by `black`, `white`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, ...).

To set the pattern of a test source explicitly you need to add an own section `source.x` (where `x` is the source's identifier) to the configuration

```
[mix]
sources = cam1,cam2

[source.cam1]
pattern = ball
```

Now source `cam1` will show a moving white ball on black background instead of a *SMPTE* signal.
Currently there is no way to change the audio test pattern.

To change the *kind* of a source you need to set the `kind` attribute in the source's configuration section as described in the following paragraphs.

##### TCP Sources

You can use `tcp` as a source's `kind` if you would like to provide Matroska A/V streams via TCP.
**TCP sources** will be assigned to port `16000` and the following in the order in which they appear in `mix/sources`.

```
[mix]
sources = cam1,cam2

[source.cam1]
kind = tcp

[source.cam2]
kind = tcp
```

This configuration let VOC2CORE listen at port `16000` for an incoming TCP connection transporting a Matroska A/V stream for source `cam1` and at port `16001` for source `cam2`.

##### Decklink Sources

You can use `decklink` as a source's `kind` if you would like to grab audio and video from a [Decklink](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink) grabber card.

```
[mix]
sources = cam1,cam2

[source.cam1]
kind = decklink
devicenumber = 1

[source.cam2]
kind = decklink
devicenumber = 3
```

You now have two **Decklink A/V grabber** sources at device number `1` for `cam1` and `3` for `cam2`.

Optional attributes of Decklink sources are:

| Attribute Name     | Example Values                                     | Default   | Description (follow link)
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -----------------------------------------
| `devicenumber`     | `0`, `1`, `2`, ...                                 | `0`       | [Decklink `device-number`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/decklink/decklinkvideosrc.html#decklinkvideosrc:device-number)
| `video_connection` | `auto`, `SDI`, `HDMI`, ...                         | `auto`    | [Decklink `connection`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/decklink/decklinkvideosrc.html#GstDecklinkConnection)
| `video_mode`       | `auto`, `1080p25`, `1080i50`, ...           			  | `auto`    | [Decklink `modes`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/decklink/decklinkvideosrc.html#decklinkvideosrc_GstDecklinkModes)
| `video_format`     | `auto`, `8bit-YUV`, `10bit-YUV`, `8bit-ARGB`, ...	| `auto`    | [Decklink `video-format`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/decklink/decklinkvideosrc.html#decklinkvideosrc_GstDecklinkVideoFormat)
| `audio_connection` | `auto`, `embedded`, `aes`, `analog`, ...           | `auto`    | [Decklink `audio-connection`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/decklink/decklinkaudiosrc.html#GstDecklinkAudioConnection)

##### Image Sources

You can use `img` as a source's `kind` if you would like to generate a still video from an image file.

```
[mix]
sources = cam1,cam2

[source.cam1]
kind = img
imguri = http://domain.com/image.jpg

[source.cam2]
kind = img
file = /opt/voctomix/image.png
```

As you see you can use either `imguri` or `file` to select an image to use.

| Attribute Name     | Example Values                                     | Default   | Description
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -----------------------------------------
| `imguri`           | `http://domain.com/image.jpg`                      | n/a       | use image from URI
| `file`             | `/opt/voctomix/image.png`                          | n/a       | use image from local file

##### Common Source Attributes

These attributes can be set for all *kinds* of sources:

| Attribute Name     | Example Values                                     | Default       | Description
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -----------------------------------------
| `mode`             | `progressive`, `interlaced`, `psf`                 | `progressive` | select video mode (`psf` = Progressive segmented frame)
| `volume`           | `0.0`, ..., `1.0`                                  | `0.0`         | audio volume (if reasonable)

#### Background Video Source

The `background` source is *obligatory* and does not have to be listed in `mix/sources`.
Background sources will be placed on bottom (z-order) of the video mix.

```
[source.background]
kind=img
file=/opt/voc/share/bg.png
```

Background sources is video only so audio sources will be ignored.

#### Blinding Video Sources

#### Blinding Audio Source

#### Overlay Sources

Overlays are placed on top (z-order) of the video mix.
Currently they can be provided as bitmap images only.
The user of **VOC2CORE** can select out of multiple overlays which are described within the configuration file or via `schedule.xml`.
